prototroph_scoring
==================

Supplemental Code

This code is released as documentation to accompany the paper
"Broad metabolic sensitivity profiling of a prototrophic yeast deletion collection"
VanderSluis & Hess et al. (in submission)


The code in "image_processing_pipeline" was used to process raw plate images
from a flatbed scanner. Included is an older matlab version of CellProfiler.
CellProfiler has since been rewritten/updated and is available elsewhere on
github.

The code in "colony_scoring_pipeline" was used to process/score the data as 
discussed in the paper. It is not intended to work "out of the box" and relies
on site-specific data structures etc. It is included as supplemental documentation
regarding methods described in the manuscript.
