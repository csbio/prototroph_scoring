% Help for the Identify Primary LoG module:
% Category: Object Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
%
% Identifies the centers of blob-like primary objects.  The result
% consists of only a single pixel per object, located near the center
% of the object.
%
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module identifies the centers of blob-like primary objects
% (e.g. nuclei) in grayscale images that show bright objects on a dark
% background.  When the objects of interest are fairly round and of
% even size, this module may be more sensitive than the methods in
% IdentifyPrimAutomatic and therefore detect objects that would
% otherwise be lost.
% 
% The result consists of only a single pixel per object, located near
% the center of the object; the IdentifySecondary module can be used
% to fill out the object based on this center point.
%
% The radius parameter should be set to the approximate radius of the
% objects of interest.  The algorithm is not very sensitive to this
% parameter.
%
% The threshold parameter tells the algorithm how inclusive to be when
% looking for objects.  Internally, each potential object is assigned
% a score that depends on both how bright the object is and how
% blob-like its shape is.  Only objects that score above the threshold
% are returned.  The threshold must be determined experimentally, but 
% the 'Automatic' setting will make a guess using Otsu's thresholding 
% method on the transformed image.  If you want the threshold to be 
% consistent across images, then use the threshold found by the 'Automatic'
% setting as a starting point for manual threshold input adjustment.  
% If the thresold is too high, objects will be lost; 
% if it is too low, spurious objects will be found.
%
% The module works by convolving the image with the Laplacian of
% Gaussian (LoG) kernel.  This is equivalent to convolving with the
% Gaussian kernel and then with the Laplace operator.  The regional
% maxima in the filter response that exceed the specificed threshold
% are identified as objects.  The radius parameter specifies the width
% of the kernel.
%
% Ultimately, this module will become an option in
% IdentifyPrimAutomatic, so that its options for maxima suppression
% and finding edges between clumps can be used.
