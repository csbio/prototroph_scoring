function handles = ExportToDatabase(handles)

% Help for the Export To Database module:
% Category: File Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Exports data in database readable format, including an importing file
% with column names and a CellProfiler Analyst properties file, if desired.
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module exports measurements to a SQL compatible format. It creates
% MySQL or Oracle scripts and associated data files which will create a
% database and import the data into it and gives you the option of creating
% a properties file for use with CellProfiler Analyst. 
% 
% This module must be run at the end of a pipeline, or second to last if 
% you are using the CreateBatchFiles module. If you forget this module, you
% can also run the ExportDatabase data tool after processing is complete; 
% its functionality is the same.
%
% The database is set up with two primary tables. These tables are the
% Per_Image table and the Per_Object table (which may have a prefix if you
% specify). The Per_Image table consists of all the Image measurements and
% the Mean and Standard Deviation of the object measurements. There is one
% Per_Image row for every image. The Per_Object table contains all the
% measurements for individual objects. There is one row of object
% measurements per object identified. The two tables are connected with the
% primary key column ImageNumber. The Per_Object table has another primary
% key called ObjectNumber, which is unique per image.
%
% The Oracle database has an extra table called Column_Names. This table is
% necessary because Oracle has the unfortunate limitation of not being able
% to handle column names longer than 32 characters. Since we must
% distinguish many different objects and measurements, our column names are
% very long. This required us to create a separate table which contains a
% short name and corresponding long name. The short name is simply "col"
% with an attached number, such as "col1" "col2" "col3" etc. The short name
% has a corresponding long name such as "Nuclei_AreaShape_Area". Each of
% the Per_Image and Per_Object columnnames are loaded as their "short name"
% but the long name can be determined from the Column_Names table.
%
% Settings:
%
% Database Type: 
% You can choose to export MySQL or Oracle database scripts. The exported
% data is the same for each type, but the setup files for MySQL and Oracle
% are different.
%
% Database Name: 
%   In MySQL, you can enter the name of a database to create or the name of
% an existing database. When using the script, if the database already
% exists, the database creation step will be skipped so the existing
% database will not be overwritten but new tables will be added. Do be
% careful, however, in choosing the Table Prefix. If you use an existing
% table name, you might unintentionally overwrite the data in that table.
%   In Oracle, when you log in you must choose a database to work with, so
% there is no need to specify the database name in this module. This also
% means it is impossible to create/destroy a database with these
% CellProfiler scripts.
%
% Table Prefix: 
% Here you can choose what to append to the table names Per_Image and
% Per_Object. If you choose "Do not use", no prefix will be appended. If you choose
% a prefix, the tables will become PREFIX_Per_Image and PREFIX_Per_Object
% in the database. If you are using the same database for all of your
% experiments, the table prefix is necessary and will be the only way to
% distinguish different experiments. If you are creating a new database for
% every experiment, then it may be easier to keep the generic Per_Image and
% Per_Object table names. Be careful when choosing the table prefix, since
% you may unintentionally overwrite existing tables.
%
% SQL File Prefix: All the CSV files will start with this prefix.
%
% Create a CellProfiler Analyst properties file: Generate a template
% properties for using your new database in CellProfiler Analyst (a data
% exploration tool which can also be downloaded from
% http://www.cellprofiler.org/)
% 
% If creating a properties file for use with CellProfiler Analyst (CPA): 
% The module will attempt to fill in as many as the entries as possible 
% based on the current handles structure. However, entries such as the 
% server name, username and password are omitted. Hence, opening the 
% properties file in CPA will produce an error since it won't be able to
% connect to the server. However, you can still edit the file in CPA and
% then fill in the required information.
%
% ********************* How To Import MySQL *******************************
% Step 1: Log onto the server where the database will be located.
%
% Step 2: From within a terminal logged into that server, navigate to folder 
% where the CSV output files and the SETUP script is located.
%
% Step 3: Type the following within the terminal to log into MySQL on the 
% server where the database will be located:
%    mysql -uUsername -pPassword -hHost
%
% Step 4: Type the following within the terminal to run SETUP script: 
%      \. DefaultDB_SETUP.SQL
%
% The SETUP file will do everything necessary to load the database.
%
% ********************* How To Import Oracle ******************************
% Step 1: Using a terminal, navigate to folder where the CSV output files
% and the SETUP script is located.
%
% Step 2: Log into SQLPlus: "sqlplus USERNAME/PASSWORD@DATABASESCRIPT"
% You may need to ask your IT department the name of DATABASESCRIPT.
%
% Step 3: Run SETUP script: "@DefaultDB_SETUP.SQL"
%
% Step 4: Exit SQLPlus: "exit"
%
% Step 5: Load data files (for columnames, images, and objects):
%
% sqlldr USERNAME/PASSWORD@DATABASESCRIPT control=DefaultDB_LOADCOLUMNS.CTL
% sqlldr USERNAME/PASSWORD@DATABASESCRIPT control=DefaultDB_LOADIMAGE.CTL
% sqlldr USERNAME/PASSWORD@DATABASESCRIPT control=DefaultDB_LOADOBJECT.CTL
%
% Step 6: Log into SQLPlus: "sqlplus USERNAME/PASSWORD@DATABASESCRIPT"
%
% Step 7: Run FINISH script: "@DefaultDB_FINISH.SQL"
%
% Technical note: This module calls the CPconvertsql function to do the
% actual exporting, which is same function as called by the ExportDatabase
% data tool.
